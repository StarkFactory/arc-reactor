# Support

## Where to Get Help

Use GitHub Issues for general questions, bug reports, and feature requests.

- Bug report: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
- Feature request: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`

## Security Issues

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
Report security concerns using the process in `SECURITY.md`.

## Maintainer Response Expectations

- Initial triage target: within 5 business days
- If an issue is accepted, maintainers will label scope/priority and propose next steps
- For release-blocking regressions, maintainers may prioritize hotfixes over roadmap features

## Support Scope

The project maintainers provide best-effort support for:

- Latest stable minor line (active support)
- Previous minor line (security and critical bug fixes only)

For detailed policy, see `docs/en/governance/support-policy.md`.
