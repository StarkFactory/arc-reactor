Date: 2026-02-18

## Highlights

- Added tag-driven GitHub Release automation.
  - Push `v*` tags and release creation is now handled by CI.
- Added CI test duration budgets to catch time regressions early.
  - Unit suite budget: 90s
  - Integration API suite budget: 150s
- Refactored MCP manager into focused components for maintainability.
  - Connection support, reconnection coordination, and store sync are now separated.
- Preserved coroutine cancellation semantics in MCP callback failure paths.

## Operational Impact

- Releases are more consistent and less manual.
- Slow test regressions are surfaced quickly in CI.
- MCP runtime code is easier to extend and review.

## Upgrade Notes
