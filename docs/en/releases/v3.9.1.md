# v3.9.1 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-18

## Highlights

- Added an explicit external integration test gate.
  - Tests tagged `external` now run only with `-PincludeExternalIntegration`.
- Strengthened module boundaries for API integration tests.
  - Policy/RAG/output-guard API integration tests and related SQL schemas are now owned by `arc-web`.
- Continued large-file decomposition for maintainability.
  - Extracted policy/feature properties from `AgentProperties.kt`.
  - Extracted `McpToolCallback` from `McpManager.kt`.
- Improved fork setup clarity.
  - Unified provider key examples to Spring AI env vars.

## Operational Impact

- Default local test runs stay fast and stable; external dependency tests are opt-in.
- CI catches web API integration regressions with clearer module ownership.
- Project structure is easier to extend in forks.

## Upgrade Notes

- Standard integration suite:
  - `./gradlew :arc-core:test :arc-web:test -PincludeIntegration --tests "com.arc.reactor.integration.*"`
- External integration suite (when needed):
  - `./gradlew test -PincludeIntegration -PincludeExternalIntegration`
- Project version is now `3.9.1`.
