# v4.7.3

Release date: 2026-03-01

## Highlights

- **Authentication and tenant safety hardening**:
  - JWT auth is now mandatory at runtime.
  - Chat requests now enforce tenant fail-close behavior (`X-Tenant-Id` required when context is absent).
  - Preflight checks fail fast when legacy auth-toggle assumptions or DB credential gaps are detected.
- **Docker runtime reliability**:
  - Fixed Docker build context so runtime module sources are included in image builds
    (`arc-web`, `arc-admin`, `arc-slack`, `arc-error-report`, `arc-google`, `arc-teams`).
  - Prevents release images from missing runtime API routes due to incomplete source copy.
- **Schema migration safety controls**:
  - Added CI immutability guard for versioned Flyway migrations (`V*.sql`).
  - Added integration regression coverage for upgrade-path validation behavior.
  - Added operations runbook for checksum mismatch recovery and controlled `flyway repair` usage.

## Compatibility and Migration

- **Operational breaking change**: `arc.reactor.auth.enabled` toggle is no longer supported for disabling auth.
- Deployments must provide:
  - `ARC_REACTOR_AUTH_JWT_SECRET`
  - valid database connectivity (or explicit non-production exceptions)
- Clients should always send `X-Tenant-Id` on chat API requests.

## Operational Notes

- Version bumped to `4.7.3`.
- Tag `v4.7.3` triggers GitHub Release and Docker publication workflows.
