# v4.0.1

Release date: 2026-02-21

## Highlights

- Stabilized release security gates for open-source/fork workflows:
  - Gitleaks switched to OSS CLI execution (no paid license dependency).
  - Security scan jobs now use full git history checkout for deterministic baseline matching.
- Preserved fail-close behavior for new secret leaks while suppressing known historical
  placeholder findings through baseline matching.
- Restored end-to-end release publication reliability for signed artifacts:
  - JAR, SBOM, checksums, signatures, provenance.

## Compatibility and Migration

- No API or configuration breaking changes from `v4.0.0`.
- Existing deployments can upgrade from `v4.0.0` to `v4.0.1` directly.

## Operational Notes

- Prefer `v4.0.1` over `v4.0.0` for production release automation.
- `v4.0.0` remains published for historical traceability, but release process fixes are in
  `v4.0.1`.
