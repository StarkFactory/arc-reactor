# v3.9.0 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-17

## Highlights

- Restored integration-test reliability by aligning test ownership with module boundaries:
  - moved policy/RAG/output-guard API integration tests to `arc-web`
- Added CI integration gate to prevent hidden regressions:
  - `:arc-core:test :arc-web:test -PincludeIntegration --tests "com.arc.reactor.integration.*"`
- Added practical Gradle defaults for faster local iteration:
  - daemon, parallel execution, build cache, incremental Kotlin compilation
- Added an explicit external-integration gate:
  - tests tagged `external` now run only with `-PincludeExternalIntegration`
- Continued large-file decomposition:
  - extracted policy/feature config classes from `AgentProperties.kt`
  - extracted `McpToolCallback` from `McpManager.kt`

## Operational Impact

- API integration failures are now surfaced in CI instead of being silently skipped.
- Forked projects can run local test/build loops faster with sensible Gradle defaults.
- Web API integration tests no longer depend on accidental module classpath behavior.

## Upgrade Notes

- Run full integration checks with:
  - `./gradlew :arc-core:test :arc-web:test -PincludeIntegration --tests "com.arc.reactor.integration.*"`
- Run external dependency integration tests explicitly when needed:
  - `./gradlew test -PincludeIntegration -PincludeExternalIntegration`
- Release docs index now includes this release (`docs/en/releases/README.md`).
- If you maintain custom CI, mirror the new integration-test step.
