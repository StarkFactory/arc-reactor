# v4.4.0

Release date: 2026-02-28

## Highlights

- **Helm chart**: Production-ready Kubernetes Helm chart at `helm/arc-reactor/` with HPA, ingress, secret management, liveness/readiness probes, and graceful shutdown support. Includes `values-production.yaml` for high-availability deployments.
- **Docker image publication**: Automated GitHub Actions workflow publishes signed images to `ghcr.io/starkfactory/arc-reactor` on every `v*` tag push with semver tags and build provenance attestation.
- **Example guides**: Four domain-specific example guides covering customer support bot, code review assistant, RAG knowledge base Q&A, and multi-agent pipeline.
- **Documentation**:
  - Error code reference covering all 11 `AgentErrorCode` values with HTTP status, trigger conditions, and client guidance.
  - Performance tuning guide with environment-specific configurations (dev / production / high-throughput).
- **Regression test coverage**: P0 security bug fix tests tagged with `@Tag("regression")` + `TracingAutoConfigurationConditionTest` verifying the admin module guard condition.
- **Bug fix**: `TracingAutoConfiguration` and `OtlpExporterConfiguration` now correctly gate on `arc.reactor.admin.enabled=true`, preventing startup failure when the admin module is not explicitly enabled.

## Compatibility and Migration

- No API changes from `v4.3.0`.
- Bug fix is transparent — apps that previously required `ARC_REACTOR_ADMIN_TRACING_ENABLED=false` as a workaround can remove that flag.
- Helm chart requires Kubernetes 1.25+. See `helm/arc-reactor/README.md` for quick start.

## Operational Notes

- Docker images are now published to `ghcr.io/starkfactory/arc-reactor:<version>` on tag push.
- Use `helm/arc-reactor/values-production.yaml` as a starting point for production deployments.
