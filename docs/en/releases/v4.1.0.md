# v4.1.0

Release date: 2026-02-26

## Highlights

- Introduced the `arc-admin` module as a first-class control plane:
  - Tenant/model pricing management
  - Metrics ingestion/query APIs
  - Dashboard and SLO query services
  - Alerting and quota enforcement
  - OTel-based tracing integration
- Added hierarchical memory and conversation summarization for long-context sessions.
- Expanded HITL and hook orchestration:
  - Metadata propagation through executor/hook/tool layers
  - Quota and HITL events with DB persistence
  - Rejection-path event capture and safer per-call HITL metadata keys

## Compatibility and Migration

- This is a feature release on top of `v4.0.1` (no API path rename migration required).
- For production persistence-enabled paths, PostgreSQL-backed runtime configuration should be prepared.

## Operational Notes

- Tag release workflow continues to publish signed artifacts with SBOM/checksum/provenance attachments.
- Use this release when adopting admin control-plane and HITL/quota observability features together.
