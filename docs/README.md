# Arc Reactor Documentation

- English docs: [docs/en/README.md](en/README.md)
- Korean docs: [docs/ko/README.md](ko/README.md)

This documentation is organized by domain instead of a flat file list:

- `getting-started`: setup, run, deploy, troubleshooting
- `architecture`: internal design and execution flows
- `governance`: auth, approval, policy and prompt operations
- `reference`: models, features, metrics, tool references
- `integrations`: channel/provider specific guides
- `releases`: release notes and upgrade highlights
